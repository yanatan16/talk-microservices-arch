# Microservices Architecture

## Abstract

Microservice-based architectural design has exploded in almost every tech industry as the cononical way to build large-scale systems, but there are still holdouts. Why do so many companies choose this path, and why do others avoid it? We examine the tangible benefits and drawbacks of microservices-based architecture. Then, I propose a novel solution to ease the friction of adopting microservices.
