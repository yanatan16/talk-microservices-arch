# The Perils of Microservices

## Abstract

We've all seen the rise of microservices to become the canonical way to build systems for many developers. There are many benefits microservices can give a team, like easier to understand applications, better separation of concerns, and less git merges. However, its not all roses. Microservice architectures break some fundamental truths about 

Microservice-based architectural design has exploded in almost every tech industry as the cononical way to build large-scale systems, but there are still holdouts. Why do so many companies choose this path, and why do others avoid it? We examine the tangible benefits and drawbacks of microservices-based architecture. Then, I propose a novel solution to ease the friction of adopting microservices.

## Outline

Perils:

- The Version Problem (monolithic versioning)
- 

- Good things
    - Smaller parts are easier to grok
    - Separation of concerns
    - Separation of teams
    - Better internal APIs
    - External comms are contained
- Bad things
    - Dev Envs are clunky
    - Cloning/Sharing a system
    - Issue tracking
- Version Problem
    - Monolithic Versioning
